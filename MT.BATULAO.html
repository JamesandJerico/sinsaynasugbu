<h3>Bato sa Ilaw: Mt. Batulao</h3>
<font color="white">
<h4><p>Mount Batulao is one experience available in Nasugbu. Furthermore, it is a popular mountain for skilled hikers to climb, as well as a favorite choice for most beginner hikers to ascend.

It is an appealing mountain to climb because its starting location is close to Metro Manila and Tagaytay City. Climbers must enter through KC Hillcrest Hotel and Golf Club and ask for directions from the gate.

According to the natives, it was derived from Bato sa Ilaw (illuminated rock), a seasonal event noticed during the final week of December in which the sun sets directly amid Batulao's two crests, generating a figure of rocks encircling a disc of red light.</p>

<p>Anyone may climb the Batulao mountains at any time of year. However, during the summer months, keep in mind that approaching the top will require going along a treeless route covered with cogon grass. As a result, the walk might become quite hot around the midday hour.

It is 811 meters above sea level and considered a small climb with a 60 to 70-degree assault, is one of the simplest climbs, according to more experienced climbers.</p>

<p>First-time climbers should heed these words of wisdom. The term "small climb" must be interpreted to mean that all mountains are difficult and dangerous in some way. Furthermore, before ascending the summit, it is advisable to see a doctor.
Hikers must also register before setting out on their journey. Give the officials at the registration location your name and phone number. Also, let them know when you'll be back.
To reach the peak, one must use extreme caution on the steep route. Hikers must be physically fit since rock scrambling is unavoidable. Also, it is not suggested for people who have chilly feet while they are at a height.</p>

Trekkers are also urged to dress appropriately for mountain climbing. Hikers will meet a cogon field, therefore long pants are recommended. Jackets or long-sleeved shirts are recommended during the chilly months.
A hiker can choose between two pathways to reach the peak. The ancient track on the east side is a more difficult path to follow. Climbers taking the ancient path are advised to carry climbing equipment such as ropes and to wear gloves. Ropes and gloves, on the other hand, are not required for the new trail on the west side.
Hikers are also advised to bring adequate drinking water with them on the trail. Although one can get a buko (coconut) drink along the way, sari-sari stores are normally an hour's walk from most campsites, and pricing may be prohibitively expensive.
And the most satisfying part of your journey will be when you reach the summit of Mount Batulao. The top offers a panoramic view of Taal Lake, the Batangas and Cavite provinces, the South China Sea, and the mountains of Pico de Loro and Mt. Maculot. At the summit, you will also discover a picture of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p>
