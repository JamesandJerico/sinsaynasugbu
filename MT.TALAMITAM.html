<h3>MT.TALAMITAM</h3>
<font color="white">
<h4><p>Mt. Talamitam, located on the other side of Nasugbu, Batangas, is formed by the same terrain as Mt. Batulao. Although it lacks the calm winds and expansive panoramas of Batulao, it is a shockingly wondrous mountain in its way, with emerald cogon grass during the wet season and a hard, 60-degree slope before the top.
Talamitam was a more lovely mountain in the past. It was called after the Talamitam trees that used to thrive on its slopes, serving as a remembrance of a period when Talamitam had rich flora and pristine ecosystems. It is now a barren mountain, but attempts are being made to restore it through tree planting and other measures.</p>

<p>The path to Talamitam is straightforward, requiring about 1.5 to 2.5 hours to reach the peak. However, because there is minimal tree cover, it may be an extremely tiring trek if the sun is high.
The path begins at the end of a rocky road drop to the Talamitam river, and from there, a short wooded journey leads to a grassland hillside with little flora. There are several path options, most of which go to the plateau where Talamitam's summit stands. It is simple to just follow whichever route leads to the top from here.</p>

<p>The summit assault takes around 20-30 minutes; there is no scrambling required, and the path is well-established, thanks to the talahib, which can slow you down, particularly during the wet season.
There are wonderful views of the nearby towns, such as Calatagan, Batangas, as well as the hills and mountains of Maragondon, from the peak, which hikers will share with the barn swallows that visit there. Notable peaks in the area include Batulao to the southeast, Mt. Makiling (which is partially hidden by the Tagaytay ridge ENE), Pico de Loro (W), and the Lubang islands (SW).</p>

<p>Returning to the town will take less than an hour, although because of the numerous pathways, you may find yourself in another area of the hamlet. As a result, it is critical to recall which track you took ascending. If you find yourself on another route, utilize the Talamitam River to find your way back; don't worry, the terminal (i.e. eastward) end of the trails all lead to the highway.
After the trip, you can clean up or take a shower at the registration area in Brgy. Aga. A visit to Tagaytay, like Mt. Batulao, is a pleasant finish. Given that ascending Mt. Talamitam can be done in half a day, a common alternative is to combine the trip with half-day hiking up Mt. Batulao as a 'Twin Dayhike.'</p>
