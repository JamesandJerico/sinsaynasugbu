<h4>KAYBIANG TUNNEL</h4>
<font color="white">
<h4><p>Kaybiang Tunnel was built in 2009 and opened to the public in 2013. It is a road tunnel that passes through Mount Palay-Palay National Park, also known as "Mt. Pico de Loro." It connects the municipalities of Ternate in Cavite and Nasugbu in Batangas and is located along the Nasugbu-Ternate Highway. This 300-meter tunnel is now the longest subterranean highway tunnel in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Because of its closeness to Metro Manila, it has become a favorite destination with road trippers, bikers, and motorcycle clubs for its gorgeous vistas and well-paved road.</p>

<p>Because of its popularity, Kaybiang Tunnel is sometimes overrun with people on weekends. As a result, it is better to schedule your vacation on a weekday to avoid the traffic congestion in the neighborhood, which is already a "typical situation" on weekends. If you're carrying a car, drive slowly and cautiously over the twisting road leading to the tunnel, and be sure to switch on your headlights when going through Kaybiang Tunnel because it's dark inside and no light can travel through.</p>
