<h3><p>Nasugbu's Church of St. Francis Xavier is a relatively recent structure, having been built mostly in the 1990s. The Nasugbu parish, which was originally under the authority of the Parish of the Immaculate Conception in Balayan, saw a tragic and gloomy turn of events in the past. Brgy. Looc saw the construction of its first church as well as a convent for the parish priest.</p>

<p>Later, the settlement relocated to its current position. A church dedicated to the Nuestra Seora Virgen de le Escalera and St. Francis Xavier was built in 1852. After the inhabitants of Nasugbu rose against the Spanish colonial rule in 1896, Spanish forces trapped about 500 men, women, and children inside the church and then set fire to it.</p>

<p>On its current site, another small wooden parish church was built. The expanding population of the town eventually prompted the building of the much bigger, current church, which began in the early 1990s. The church was designated as a pilgrimage church during the Archdiocese of Lipa's Centennial Celebration.</p>

<p>The church's historic bell, which was manufactured in Spain and bears the king's royal stamp, stands in front of the main door. The interior features a stunning barrel vaulted ceiling painted in trompe l'oeil manner. Expensive wooden carvings adorn the main altar, which is topped by a dome. It has a restored antique crucifix that is larger than life. St. Joseph, the patron of Batangas, is enthroned on the Gospel side, while the Immaculate Conception is enthroned on the Epistle side. St. Francis Xavier is seen surmounting the top arch beneath an ancient depiction of the Most Blessed Holy Trinity. The Tabernacle of the Most Holy Sacrament serves as the majestic altar's focal point. An ossuarium is located under the church altar.</p>
