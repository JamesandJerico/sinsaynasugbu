<h4>FORTUNEISLAND</h4>
<font color="white">
<h4><p>Fortune Island, located on Nasugbu Bay, is close to the archeological site where the renowned San Diego Ship Wreck with valuable relics was discovered. It is also known to have staged the first recorded naval fight between European troops in the Southeast Asia region.
The island ultimately became an elite luxury resort, which finally shuttered and appeared to be abandoned for some time. It reopened to the public in 2013, and it has since become popular with campers and visitors looking to explore their beach alternatives in the area. There is no electricity or access to drinking or fresh water on the island, but more people are coming as photographs of the island's fine sand and solitude pique their interest, as do the Instagram-favorite Greek-style pillars and ruins that exist on its shore.</p>
<p>Other activities on the island include walking to the lighthouse, snorkeling, and cliff diving, in addition to camping and photo shoots. Camping is permitted overnight. There are a few scuba diving locations around the island if you have extra time. There are no stores or resorts, so pack your tent, food, and water. Showers and toilet facilities, on the other hand, are provided for a small price at the mainland resorts.
You can also choose to visit the island for a day and then return to Barangay Wawa to stay in one of the Nasugbu mainland resorts. Fortune Island Resort is a popular option since it also serves as the starting point for trips to and from the island.</p>
