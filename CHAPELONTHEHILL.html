<h4>CHAPELONTHEHILL</h4>

<h3><p>The Salesians of Don Bosco (SDB) put it succinctly: "Welcome to the mountain experience!" "This perfectly characterizes Mary Help of Christians Center of Spirituality at Batulao in Nasugbu, Batangas." The entire complex is essentially a center for spiritual experiences such as retreats and recalls, featuring amenities and services such as rooms, dorms, function rooms, and conference halls. However, the Chapel on the Hill is its most well-known feature. Fortunately, "Batulao" means "light on the hill," and this appears to be what the chapel is: a sanctuary bringing light to individuals seeking inner calm.</p>

<p>The Chapel, which was dedicated on October 27, 2004, in memory of Aurelio and Antonia Reyes by their daughter Rosario Reyes Bartolome, is a circular construction that resembles a gazebo. The Chapel on the Hill, on the other hand, features glass-enclosed side panels, unlike another famous circular chapel in the nation, the Church of the Holy Sacrifice at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City, which has open side panels. This provides a spectacular, yet peaceful, 360-degree view of the valley and the West Philippine Sea (also known as the South China Sea).
The Chapel's most notable feature, however, is the circular floor pattern known as the Labyrinth: "a holy circle with a solitary route leading to its center." Walking the walk allows for prayer and meditation. This kinesthetic type of prayer is especially beneficial when words cannot communicate the depths and heights of our experience." The SDB suggests four motions to utilize and spiritual approaches to "the Labyrinth walk," which is a recreation of a pilgrim practice from the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>These are some of the reasons why the Chapel on the Hill is not just a popular spiritual retreat facility but also a popular wedding site. The peacefulness is awe-inspiring; the environment is intimate with the native-inspired seats, the wood accents â€“ both in the outside and interiors, the stained glass window over the altar, the muted lighting, and the airy sensation created by glass doors and windows. Weddings around dusk or early evening would benefit greatly from the dramatic natural light from the setting sun. The chilly climate caused by the height is also a big bonus.
The Chapel on the Hill is a two-hour trip from Metro Manila through Tagaytay City. Turn right to Nasugbu from Tagaytay City, and then left at the welcome arch to Evercrest Hotel and Resort. The spot is roughly a kilometer distant and will be marked by road signage. The church has the same main gate entry as the Transfiguration Chapel of Caleruega, another popular wedding site.</p>
