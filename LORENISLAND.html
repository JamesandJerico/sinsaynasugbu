<h4>LOREN ISLAND</h4>
<font color="white">
<h3><p>Loren Island is located in Nasugbu, Batangas, about 3 to 4 hours from Manila. The island is known locally as Pulo Island, but it is currently owned by Senator Loren Legarda, hence the name Loren Island. The island has no facilities, yet the lack of these conveniences adds beauty and a basic living ambiance. If you're going to visit and like beach camping, be sure to include Loren Island on your list of beach objectives.</p>

<p>The island has a stunning view and a peaceful ambiance, especially at night. The sand is creamy and pebbly in places, rather than white. For a brief trip, the beach is an excellent playground. The island is bordered by lush greenery and rocky outcroppings. It also features several little caves and coves ideal for swimming. The coastline on the extreme right side of the island is rocky and steep, but there is a sand bar on the opposite side that links to another islet. The sound of the birds and the crashing waves on the coast created a beautiful sensation of utter connectedness to nature.</p>

<p>The island has the potential to be a popular tourist destination, but we must maintain its natural beauty to retain its majesty.</p>
